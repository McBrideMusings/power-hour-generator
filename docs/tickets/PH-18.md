# Dry-Run Mode for Render

Add `--dry-run` flag that shows what would change without executing.

## Output Format

```
DRY RUN: 3 segments would be rendered, 57 would be skipped

  RENDER  003  teenagers          (start_time changed: 1:30 → 1:45)
  RENDER  015  chambea            (new row)
  SKIP    001  bohemian_rhapsody  (up to date)
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- `--dry-run` reports what would change
- Shows reason for each render (input changed, new row, deleted output, config changed)
- No FFmpeg processes executed
- Works with `--json` flag
