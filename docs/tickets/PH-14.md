# FFmpeg Concat Execution Modes

Implement both stream copy and re-encode concat modes.

## Stream Copy (Default)

`-f concat -safe 0 -i concat.txt -c copy` — fast, no quality loss, requires compatible formats.

## Re-encode (`--reencode`)

Full decode/encode pass — handles format-mismatched segments at the cost of speed and quality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Stream copy mode works for compatible segments
- Re-encode mode handles mixed formats
- Output reports path, duration, file size
- Tests for command construction
