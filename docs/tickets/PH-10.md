# Table-Driven Tests for Timeline Interleave Patterns

Comprehensive test coverage for all timeline interleave patterns.

## Test Cases

- Single collection (no interleave)
- Two collections with `every: 1`
- Two collections with `every: N`
- Interstitials cycling (fewer interstitials than insertion points)
- Intro + songs + outro
- Full sequence: intro + songs with interstitials + outro
- Empty collections
- Missing collection references (error case)

## Acceptance Criteria

- All interleave patterns covered
- Edge cases tested (empty, missing, cycling)
- Table-driven test structure
