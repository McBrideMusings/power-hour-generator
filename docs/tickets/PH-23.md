# Library CLI Commands

Add CLI commands for managing the shared media library.

## Commands

```bash
powerhour library list [--json]              # List all sources
powerhour library search <query> [--json]    # Search by title/artist/URL
powerhour library info [--json]              # Stats (files, disk usage)
powerhour library verify [--fix]             # Integrity check (ffprobe)
powerhour library prune [--dry-run]          # Remove unreferenced sources
powerhour library import --project <dir>     # Import project cache
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- All library commands functional
- Search works by title, artist, and URL
- Verify detects corrupt files, `--fix` re-downloads
- Prune identifies unreferenced sources
- Import migrates project-local caches to shared library
- All commands support `--json`
