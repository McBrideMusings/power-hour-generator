# External File Loading with Merge and Duplicate Detection

Implement the file loading and merge behavior for split configs.

## Merge Behavior

- Inline definitions loaded first
- File references merged in order
- Duplicate names are an error (not silently overwritten)
- File paths relative to project root

## Acceptance Criteria

- Files loaded and merged correctly
- Duplicate names produce clear errors
- `config show` displays the fully merged effective config
- Tests for all loading combinations (inline only, files only, mixed, duplicates)
