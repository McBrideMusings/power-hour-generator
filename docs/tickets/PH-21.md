# Update config show for Merged Config Display

Update `powerhour config show` to display the fully merged effective configuration after resolving all external file references.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `config show` displays merged config from all sources
- Clear indication of which values came from which files (optional)
- `init` continues generating single-file configs
- CSV remains the plan format
